Creighton4Good is Creighton University’s open source software development lab, governed collaboratively by faculty and students. This manual defines governance processes, roles, and accountability structures to ensure the lab operates transparently, ethically, and in alignment with the University’s Jesuit mission.

1. Governance Overview
Creighton4Good operates under a shared governance model combining faculty oversight with student-led project management. This approach balances educational mentorship with authentic open source participation.

##Program Roles: 
###Faculty Advisory Committee 
•	Provides oversight, ensures policy compliance, and approves projects and partnerships. Coordinates program and course collaborations. 
###Student Leadership Team (Internship)
•	Coordinates projects, develops software, and manages repositories and operations. Manage individual projects, documentation, and sprint cycles. 
###Contributors
•	Participate in the development, testing, design, and documentation processes. Support the program and projects through volunteer work and coursework.

2. Faculty Advisory Committee
Comprised of at least three faculty members from the Department of Computer Science, Design, and Journalism.

###Responsibilities include: 
• Approving new project proposals 
• Ensuring license and policy compliance 
• Providing mentorship to student leaders 
• Reviewing annual reports and lab operations 
• Representing Creighton4Good in external partnerships 

Meetings are held monthly during active semesters. 

3. Student Leadership Team
Student leaders serve as the operational core of Creighton4Good. Two co-leads (technical and organizational) are selected annually, alongside project leads and optional documentation or communications roles.
###Responsibilities include:
• Coordinating sprint planning and development cycles
• Managing GitHub organization settings and contributor onboarding
• Reviewing pull requests and documentation
• Mentoring peers and reporting progress to faculty advisors

4. Project Governance
Projects follow a four-stage lifecycle: Proposal, Active Development, Maintenance, and Archival. Each stage ensures continuity, mentorship, and documentation for future contributors.

5. Decision-Making and Voting
Decisions are classified as technical, programmatic, or governance-related. Technical decisions are made by contributors; programmatic and governance decisions require faculty involvement or approval as outlined in the charter.

6. Meetings and Communication
Regular meetings foster collaboration and accountability:
• Weekly stand-ups: Student contributors
• Biweekly sprint reviews
• Monthly faculty advisory meetings
• End-of-semester retrospectives for reflection and feedback

7. Transparency and Documentation
When possible, all program documents will be maintained in a public GitHub repository. Each project must include standard files: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md, MAINTAINERS.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

8. External Partnerships and Funding
All partnerships must align with Creighton’s mission and be reviewed by the Faculty Advisory Committee. External funding and sponsorships require approval from both the committee and the University.

9. Evaluation and Accountability
Student leaders are evaluated each semester based on project outcomes, mentorship effectiveness, and reflection. The Faculty Advisory Committee may produce an annual report or research article to share impact, outcomes, and sustainability.

10. Amendment Procedure
Governance policies may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the Faculty Advisory Committee. Approved amendments are published in the governance directory.
