# 1. Purpose and Mission
Creighton4Good is Creighton University’s open source software development lab.
It serves as a collaborative learning environment where students, faculty, and community partners co-create and maintain open source software that advances the common good.
### Our mission is to:
- Provide experiential learning through real-world software development.
- Cultivate student leadership, technical excellence, and ethical decision-making grounded in Creighton’s Jesuit values.
- Support projects that strengthen local communities, nonprofit organizations, and socially responsible technology ecosystems.
- Contribute to global open source initiatives that align with the University’s mission of service and justice.
 
# 2. Governance Structure
## 2.1 Faculty Governance
Creighton4Good operates under the direction of a Faculty Advisory Committee drawn from the Department of Computer Science, Design, and Journalism.
### Responsibilities include:
- Approving new projects and partnerships.
- Ensuring compliance with University policies, accessibility standards, and open source licensing.
- Mentoring student leaders and aligning project work with course and program learning outcomes.
- Securing resources and fostering long-term sustainability for ongoing projects.
  
Faculty advisors model cura personalis—care for the whole person—by guiding students not only in technical skill but in reflection, collaboration, and social responsibility.
 
## 2.2 Student Leadership
Creighton4Good is primarily student-led, with faculty providing mentorship and oversight.
Student Leads (appointed or elected each semester) coordinate project teams, manage repositories, and ensure that work reflects open source values of transparency, collaboration, and inclusion.
Responsibilities include:
- Managing issue boards, documentation, and release schedules.
- Upholding coding standards and the lab’s Code of Conduct.
- Mentoring newer contributors and organizing onboarding activities.
- Communicating regularly with faculty advisors and community partners.
 
## 2.3 Contributors
Participation in Creighton4Good is open to:
- Students enrolled in related courses, independent studies, or internships.
- Volunteers interested in open source, service-learning, or civic technology.
- External collaborators approved by the Faculty Advisory Committee.
All contributors must adhere to the lab’s Code of Conduct and follow contributor guidelines to ensure respectful, inclusive collaboration.
 
# 3. Project Scope
Creighton4Good prioritizes projects that:
- Serve community partners, nonprofits, and public-interest initiatives.
- Support campus innovation and educational technology efforts.
- Advance research, sustainability, and social justice through open collaboration.
All projects must be released under an OSI-approved open source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPLv3), reviewed and approved by faculty.
 
# 4. Operations and Practices
- Transparency: All projects are hosted in public repositories (e.g., GitHub) with visible issue tracking, documentation, and release notes.
- Code Review: Every code contribution must be reviewed by peers and/or faculty mentors before merging.
- Documentation: Each project maintains installation, contribution, and governance documentation to support continuity.
- Meetings: Student teams hold regular sprint reviews, stand-ups, and end-of-semester retrospectives.
- Community Standards: Creighton4Good adopts a Code of Conduct modeled after the the [contributor covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
